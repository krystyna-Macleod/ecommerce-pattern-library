the buttons use our primary colour to draw attention and stand out. Each Button has a specific purpose:

- The regular buttons are for cards, forms and where the background is a light colour.
- The light buttons are for dark background areas.
- The ghost button should be used exclusively on banners where the background is an image.

Feel free to mix them with the 'font-size' classes to make different sizes of buttons.
